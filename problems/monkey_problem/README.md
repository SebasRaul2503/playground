# Infinite Monkey Theorem

## Overview
The infinite monkey theorem is a probabilistic thought experiment that posits if a monkey randomly hits keys on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time, it will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. The name of the theorem comes from the humorous image of a monkey randomly producing recognizable text.

## Background
This theorem is often used to illustrate the concepts of infinity and randomness in discussions of probability. It is based on the mathematical premise that a random sequence of letters, given infinite time, will eventually form coherent words and sentences.

## Implications
The theorem suggests that mere randomness can potentially lead to structured outcomes, given enough time or a sufficient number of attempts. It serves as a metaphor in discussions about the power of chance, the nature of creativity, and the limits of human intuition when confronted with concepts of infinity.
