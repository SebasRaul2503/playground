# Custom Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) in Java

## Project Overview
This project explores the concept of pseudo-random number generation using a custom implementation of the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) method in Java. The core of this project is to demonstrate the predictable nature of standard pseudo-random number generators.

## Problem Statement
Standard pseudo-random number generators, like Javaâ€™s `Random` class, are not truly random. They are deterministic and produce predictable sequences of numbers if the seed is known. This predictability can be a significant drawback in scenarios where unpredictability is crucial, such as in cryptographic applications or simulations.
